# Introduction to Cloud-Native

Cloud-native refers to the set of practices that empowers an organization to build and manage applications at scale. 
They can achieve this goal by using private, hybrid, or public cloud providers. In addition to scale, 
an organization needs to be agile in integrating customer feedback and adapting to the surrounding technology ecosystem.

Containers are closely associated with cloud-native terminology. Containers are used to run a single application with all required dependencies. 
The main characteristics of containers are easy to manage, deploy, and fast to recover. As such, often, a microservice-based architecture is chosen in tandem with cloud-native tooling.
Microservices are used to manage and configure a collection of small, independent services that can be easily packaged and executed within a container.
