Kubernetes had its first initial release in 2014 and it derives from Borg, a Google open-source container orchestrator. Currently, Kubernetes is part of CNCF or Cloud Native Computing Foundation. CNCF was founded in 2015, and it provides a vendor-neutral home to open-source projects such as Kubernetes, Prometheus, ETCD, Envoy, and many more.
